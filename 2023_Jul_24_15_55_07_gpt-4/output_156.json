If something sees the cow and the cow sees the lion then it is nice. If something is young and nice then it sees the cat. If something sees the dog and it sees the cow then it is green. If something needs the cow and it does not need the lion then the lion is blue. If something sees the lion and it visits the lion then the lion visits the cow. All nice things are young. If something sees the cat and the cat needs the cow then the cat is nice. If the cat is not nice then the cat is not blue. Question: The cat does not see the cat.?",
