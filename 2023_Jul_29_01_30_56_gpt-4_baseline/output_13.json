If something sees the rabbit then the rabbit is cold. If something sees the tiger then the tiger is kind. If something is round then it is kind. If the rabbit sees the lion and the rabbit sees the mouse then the mouse sees the tiger. If something is kind then it sees the mouse. If something is blue and kind then it sees the rabbit. If something chases the lion and the lion chases the rabbit then the rabbit chases the mouse. If something is kind and it sees the mouse then it sees the lion.\nQuestion: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? The mouse does not see the rabbit.",
