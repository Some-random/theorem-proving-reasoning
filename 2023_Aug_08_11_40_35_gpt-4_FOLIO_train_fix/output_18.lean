-- Context from the information

-- All fruits with the color red contain a large amount of vitamin C.
axiom A1 : ∀ (f : Fruit), is_red f → contains_large_vitamin_C f
-- All apples are fruits with the color red.
axiom A2 : ∀ (f : Fruit), is_apple f → is_red f
-- All fruits containing a large amount of vitamin C are beneficial to people.
axiom A3 : ∀ (f : Fruit), contains_large_vitamin_C f → is_beneficial_to_people f
-- No fruits that are beneficial to people are on a warning list.
axiom A4 : ∀ (f : Fruit), is_beneficial_to_people f → ¬ is_on_warning_list f
-- If K is not beneficial to people and also not an apple, then it is a fruit with the color red.
axiom A5 : ¬ is_beneficial_to_people K ∧ ¬ is_apple K → is_red K

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
-- K is an apple.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem K_is_apple : is_apple K :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem not_K_is_apple : ¬ is_apple K :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- The answer is Unknown

-- Question 2
-- K either contains a large amount of vitamin C or is on a warning list.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem K_vitamin_C_or_warning : contains_large_vitamin_C K ∨ is_on_warning_list K :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem not_K_vitamin_C_or_warning : ¬ (contains_large_vitamin_C K ∨ is_on_warning_list K) :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- The answer is Unknown

-- Question 3
-- K is either on a warning list or with the color red.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem K_warning_or_red : is_on_warning_list K ∨ is_red K :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem not_K_warning_or_red : ¬ (is_on_warning_list K ∨ is_red K) :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- The answer is Unknown

-- Question 4
-- If K is either beneficial to people or on a warning list, then it is not red.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem K_beneficial_or_warning_implies_not_red : 
(is_beneficial_to_people K ∨ is_on_warning_list K) → ¬ is_red K :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem not_K_beneficial_or_warning_implies_not_red : 
¬ ((is_beneficial_to_people K ∨ is_on_warning_list K) → ¬ is_red K) :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- The answer is Unknown

-- Question 5
-- If K is either on a warning list or with the color red, then it is not beneficial to people and does not contain a large amount of vitamin C.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem K_warning_or_red_implies_not_beneficial_and_not_vitamin_C : 
(is_on_warning_list K ∨ is_red K) → ¬ is_beneficial_to_people K ∧ ¬ contains_large_vitamin_C K :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem not_K_warning_or_red_implies_not_beneficial_and_not_vitamin_C : 
¬ ((is_on_warning_list K ∨ is_red K) → ¬ is_beneficial_to_people K ∧ ¬ contains_large_vitamin_C K) :=
begin
