-- Introducing basic types for entities in our universe.
constant Community : Type
constant County : Type
constant Route : Type

-- Defining specific instances of communities, counties, and routes.
constant Ordinary : Community
constant ElliotCounty : County
constant KentuckyRoute32 : Route

-- Defining properties and relations among the entities.
constant is_unincorporated : Community → Prop
constant is_located_in : Community → County → Prop
constant is_on_route : Community → Route → Prop

-- Providing axioms based on the information given.

-- Ordinary is an unincorporated community.
axiom A1 : is_unincorporated Ordinary
-- Located within Elliot County, Ordinary is on Kentucky Route 32.
axiom A2 : is_located_in Ordinary ElliotCounty
axiom A3 : is_on_route Ordinary KentuckyRoute32

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
-- There are no unincorporated communities along Kentucky Route 32.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem no_unincorporated_on_route32 : ¬ ∃ (c : Community), is_unincorporated c ∧ is_on_route c KentuckyRoute32 :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem exists_unincorporated_on_route32 : ∃ (c : Community), is_unincorporated c ∧ is_on_route c KentuckyRoute32 :=
begin
    existsi Ordinary,
    split,
    exact A1,
    exact A3,
end

-- The answer is False

-- Question 2
-- There is an unincorporated community in Elliot County.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
theorem exists_unincorporated_in_elliot : ∃ (c : Community), is_unincorporated c ∧ is_located_in c ElliotCounty :=
begin
    existsi Ordinary,
    split,
    exact A1,
    exact A2,
end

-- Let's try the negative case.

theorem no_unincorporated_in_elliot : ¬ ∃ (c : Community), is_unincorporated c ∧ is_located_in c ElliotCounty :=
begin
    sorry, -- Placeholder for proof
end

-- The answer is True
