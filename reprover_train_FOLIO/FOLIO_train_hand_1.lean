-- Evaluate the question's statement: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance music.

-- Let's first prove the positive case

theorem no_choral_conductor_specialized_in_renaissance : ¬ specialized_in_renaissance miroslav_venhoda :=
begin
    -- The aim is to show a contradiction.
    intro h, 
    exact A2 h,
    sorry,
end

-- Looks like the positive case is not provable. Let's try the negative case.

theorem choral_conductor_specialized_in_renaissance : specialized_in_renaissance miroslav_venhoda :=
begin
    -- The aim is to show a contradiction.
    exact A2,
end

-- The negative case can be proven in Lean. So
-- The answer is False
