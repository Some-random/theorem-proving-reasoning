-- Introducing basic types for entities in our universe.
constant Person : Type

-- Defining the property of a person being an athlete
constant Athlete : Person → Prop
-- Defining the property of a person being good at sports
constant Good_at_sports : Person → Prop
-- Defining the property of a person being an Olympic gold medal winner
constant Olympic_gold_medal_winner : Person → Prop
-- Defining the property of a person being a scientist
constant Scientist : Person → Prop
-- Defining the property of a person being a Nobel laureate
constant Nobel_laureate : Person → Prop
-- Amy is a specific person
constant Amy : Person

-- All athletes are good at sports
axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), Athlete p → Good_at_sports p
-- All Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), Olympic_gold_medal_winner p → Athlete p
-- No scientists are good at sports
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), Scientist p → ¬ Good_at_sports p
-- All Nobel laureates are scientists
axiom A4 : ∀ (p : Person), Nobel_laureate p → Scientist p
-- Amy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner
axiom A5 : Good_at_sports Amy ∨ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy
-- If Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner
axiom A6 : ¬ Nobel_laureate Amy → ¬ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
-- Amy is an athlete.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.

theorem not_Amy_is_Nobel_laureate : ¬ (¬ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy → Nobel_laureate Amy) :=
begin
  intro h,
  
  -- Contraposition: If Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.
  have h1 : ¬ Nobel_laureate Amy → Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy, {
      intro h1,
      have h2 : ¬ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy, from A6 h1,
      cc,
  },
  
  have h2 : ¬ Nobel_laureate Amy, {
      intro h3,
      have h4 := A3 Amy (A4 Amy h3),
      cases A5, {
          cc,
      }, {
          have h5 := A1 Amy (A2 Amy h_1),
          cc,
      }
  },
  exact (A6 h2) (h1 h2),
end

-- The answer is Unknown
