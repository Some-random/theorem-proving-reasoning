-- Defining the property of a person being an athlete

-- All athletes are good at sports
axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), Athlete p → Good_at_sports p
-- All Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), Olympic_gold_medal_winner p → Athlete p
-- No scientists are good at sports
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), Scientist p → ¬ Good_at_sports p
-- All Nobel laureates are scientists
axiom A4 : ∀ (p : Person), Nobel_laureate p → Scientist p
-- Amy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner
axiom A5 : Good_at_sports Amy ∨ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy
-- If Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner
axiom A6 : ¬ Nobel_laureate Amy → ¬ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
-- Amy is an athlete.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.

theorem not_Amy_is_Nobel_laureate : ¬ (¬ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy → Nobel_laureate Amy) :=
begin
    intro h,
    have h1 : ¬ Scientist Amy, {
        intro h,
        have h2 := A3 Amy h,
        cases A5, {
            contradiction,
        }, {
            have h3 := A2 Amy h_1,
            have h4 := A1 Amy h3,
            contradiction,
        }
    },
    have h2 : ¬ Olympic_gold_medal_winner Amy, {
        intro h,
        have h3 := A2 Amy h,
        have h4 := A1 Amy h3,
        by_cases Nobel_laureate Amy, {
            have scientist_Amy := A4 Amy h,
            have not_Good_at_sports_Amy := A3 Amy scientist_Amy,
            contradiction,
        }, {
            have not_Olympic_gold_medal_winner_Amy := A6 h,
            contradiction,
        }
    },
    have h3 : ¬ Nobel_laureate Amy, {
        intro h1,
        have not_Scientist_Amy := A4 Amy h1,

    },
