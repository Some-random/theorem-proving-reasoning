axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Smart x → Big x -- Corresponds to 'Smart people are big'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Quiet x ∧ Smart x → Red x -- Corresponds to 'If someone is quiet and smart then they are red'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Nice x ∧ Red x → Smart x -- Corresponds to 'Nice, red people are smart'

axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Young x → Red x -- Corresponds to 'Young people are red'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Red x ∧ Quiet x → Big x -- Corresponds to 'All red, quiet people are big'

-- So let's try to prove the negation of the theorem, which is Fiona is nice
theorem fiona_is_nice : Nice Fiona :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R4, which states that if someone is big and young then they are nice.
  apply R4,
  -- We now need to show that Fiona is big and young.
  split,
  -- To show that Fiona is big, we apply rule R1, which states that smart people are big.
  -- We know that red, white people are smart (by rule R7), so we need to show that Fiona is red and white.
  -- We know that young people are red (by rule R5), and red, young people are white (by rule R9), so Fiona is red and white, and therefore smart, and therefore big.
  apply R1,
  apply R7,
  split,
  apply R5,
  exact T8,
  apply R9,
  split,
  apply R5,
  exact T8,
  exact T8,
  -- Fiona is young by axiom T8.
  exact T8,
end

-- It can be proven in Lean. So
-- The answer is False
