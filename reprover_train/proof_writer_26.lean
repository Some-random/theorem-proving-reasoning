-- Define our axioms based on the provided statements
axiom T1 : Furry Anne -- Corresponds to 'Anne is furry'
axiom T2 : Rough Anne -- Corresponds to 'Anne is rough'
axiom T3 : White Anne -- Corresponds to 'Anne is white'
axiom T4 : Nice Bob -- Corresponds to 'Bob is nice'
axiom T5 : Rough Bob -- Corresponds to 'Bob is rough'

axiom T8 : White Dave -- Corresponds to 'Dave is white'
axiom T9 : Furry Fiona -- Corresponds to 'Fiona is furry'
axiom T10 : Quiet Fiona -- Corresponds to 'Fiona is quiet'

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Quiet x ∧ Red x → Furry x -- Corresponds to 'All quiet, red people are furry'
axiom R2 : Green Dave ∧ Nice Dave → Red Dave -- Corresponds to 'If Dave is green and Dave is nice then Dave is red'
axiom R3 : White Fiona ∧ Green Fiona → Quiet Fiona -- Corresponds to 'If Fiona is white and Fiona is green then Fiona is quiet'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Nice x → Furry x -- Corresponds to 'All nice people are furry'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Furry x → Green x -- Corresponds to 'If someone is furry then they are green'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Furry x ∧ Quiet x → Nice x -- Corresponds to 'If someone is furry and quiet then they are nice'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Green x → Quiet x -- Corresponds to 'If someone is green then they are quiet'
axiom R8 : ∀ x : obj, Rough x → Furry x -- Corresponds to 'All rough people are furry'

-- Theorem: Dave is red?
theorem dave_is_red : Red Dave :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that if Dave is green and Dave is nice then Dave is red.
  apply R2,
  -- We now need to show that Dave is green and Dave is nice.
  split,
  -- To show that Dave is green, we apply rule R5, which states that if someone is furry then they are green.
  -- We know that Dave is rough (by axiom T7), and all rough people are furry (by rule R8), so Dave is furry, and therefore green.
  apply R5,
  apply R8,
  exact T7,
  -- To show that Dave is nice, we apply rule R6, which states that if someone is furry and quiet then they are nice.
  -- We know that Dave is furry (from above), so we need to show that Dave is quiet.
  -- We apply rule R7, which states that if someone is green then they are quiet.
  -- We know that Dave is green (from above), so Dave is quiet, and therefore nice.
  apply R6,
  split,
  -- Dave is furry (from above).
  apply R8,
  exact T7,
  -- Dave is quiet (from above).
  apply R7,
  apply R5,
  apply R8,
  exact T7,

-- The answer is True
