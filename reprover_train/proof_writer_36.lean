-- Theorem: Erin is kind?
theorem erin_is_kind : Kind Erin :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that if someone is blue, then they are kind.
  apply R2,
  -- We now need to show that Erin is blue.
  -- We apply rule R8, which states that if someone is white and round, then they are blue.
  apply R8,
  -- We now need to show that Erin is white and round.
  split,
  -- We apply rule R9, which states that if someone is furry, then they are white.
  apply R9,
  -- We know that Erin is furry from axiom T5.
  exact T5,
  -- We apply rule R6, which states that if someone is nice, then they are round.
  apply R6,
  -- We now need to show that Erin is nice.
  -- We apply rule R1, which states that if someone is white, then they are nice.
  apply R1,
  -- We know that Erin is white from the previous step.
  apply R9,
  -- We know that Erin is furry from axiom T5.
  exact T5,
end

-- The answer is True
