-- Theorem: Anne is nice?
theorem anne_is_nice : Nice Anne :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R4, which states that if something is blue and round then it is nice.
  apply R4,
  -- We now need to show that Anne is blue and round.
  split,
  -- Anne is blue by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
  -- To show that Anne is round, we apply rule R9, which states that if Anne is furry and big then Anne is round.
  apply R9,
  -- We now need to show that Anne is furry and big.
  split,
  -- To show that Anne is furry, we apply rule R1, which states that all blue, big things are furry.
  -- We know that Anne is blue (by axiom T1), so we need to show that Anne is big.
  -- We apply rule R3, which states that all cold, smart things are big.
  -- We know that Anne is smart (by axiom T2), so we need to show that Anne is cold.
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that if Anne is smart then Anne is cold.
  -- We know that Anne is smart (by axiom T2), so Anne is cold.
  apply R1,
  split,
  exact T1,
  apply R3,

  exact T2,
  -- Anne is big by the above proof.

-- The answer is True
