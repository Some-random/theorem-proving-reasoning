-- Theorem: Bob is blue?
theorem bob_is_blue : Blue Bob :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R8, which states that all big people are blue.
  apply R8,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is big.
  -- We apply rule R5, which states that if someone is round then they are big.
  apply R5,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is round.
  -- We apply rule R7, which states that if someone is white then they are round.
  apply R7,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is white.
  -- We apply rule R1, which states that red, green people are white.
  apply R1,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is red and green.
  split,
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that if someone is green then they are red.
  apply R2,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is green.
  -- This is given by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is green.
  -- This is given by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
end

-- The answer is True
