-- Define our axioms based on the provided statements
axiom T1 : Nice Bob -- Corresponds to 'Bob is nice'
axiom T2 : Cold Charlie -- Corresponds to 'Charlie is cold'
axiom T3 : Quiet Charlie -- Corresponds to 'Charlie is quiet'
axiom T4 : Cold Dave -- Corresponds to 'Dave is cold'
axiom T5 : Blue Gary -- Corresponds to 'Gary is blue'
axiom T6 : Furry Gary -- Corresponds to 'Gary is furry'
axiom T7 : Nice Gary -- Corresponds to 'Gary is nice'

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Kind x → Blue x -- Corresponds to 'All kind things are blue'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Kind x → Green x -- Corresponds to 'Kind things are green'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Nice x → Green x -- Corresponds to 'Nice things are green'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Green x → Kind x -- Corresponds to 'If something is green then it is kind'
axiom R5 : Furry Gary ∧ Nice Gary → ¬ Quiet Gary -- Corresponds to 'If Gary is furry and Gary is nice then Gary is not quiet'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Green x ∧ ¬ Kind x → Furry x -- Corresponds to 'If something is green and not kind then it is furry'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x → Furry x -- Corresponds to 'If something is blue then it is furry'
axiom R8 : ∀ x : obj, Nice x ∧ Furry x → ¬ Cold x -- Corresponds to 'If something is nice and furry then it is not cold'
axiom R9 : ∀ x : obj, Cold x ∧ ¬ Furry x → ¬ Quiet x -- Corresponds to 'If something is cold and not furry then it is not quiet'

-- Theorem: Bob is not cold?
theorem bob_is_not_cold : ¬ Cold Bob :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R8, which states that if something is nice and furry, then it is not cold.
  apply R8,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is nice and furry.
  split,
  -- Bob is nice by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
  -- To show that Bob is furry, we apply rule R7, which states that if something is blue, then it is furry.
  -- We know that kind things are blue (by rule R1), so we need to show that Bob is kind.
  -- We apply rule R4, which states that if something is green, then it is kind.
  -- We know that nice things are green (by rule R3), so Bob is green, and therefore kind.
  apply R7,
  apply R1,
  apply R4,
  exact R3 Bob T1,
end

-- The answer is True
