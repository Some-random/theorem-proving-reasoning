constant obj : Type u

-- Declare constants for our objects
constant Cat : obj -- Corresponds to 'The cat'
constant Cow : obj -- Corresponds to 'The cow'
constant Squirrel : obj -- Corresponds to 'The squirrel'
constant Rabbit : obj -- Corresponds to 'The rabbit'

-- Declare constants for our predicates
constant Needs : obj → obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'needs'
constant Sees : obj → obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'sees'
constant Chases : obj → obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'chases'
constant Kind : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is kind'
constant Red : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is red'
constant Round : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is round'
constant Young : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is young'
constant Cold : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is cold'

-- Define our axioms based on the provided statements
axiom T1 : Needs Cat Cow -- Corresponds to 'The cat needs the cow'
axiom T2 : Needs Cow Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'The cow needs the squirrel'
axiom T3 : Sees Cow Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'The cow sees the squirrel'
axiom T4 : Chases Rabbit Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'The rabbit chases the squirrel'
axiom T5 : Kind Rabbit -- Corresponds to 'The rabbit is kind'
axiom T6 : Red Rabbit -- Corresponds to 'The rabbit is red'
axiom T7 : Round Rabbit -- Corresponds to 'The rabbit is round'
axiom T8 : Needs Rabbit Cat -- Corresponds to 'The rabbit needs the cat'
axiom T9 : Round Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'The squirrel is round'
axiom T10 : Needs Squirrel Cow -- Corresponds to 'The squirrel needs the cow'

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Chases x Cow → Young x -- Corresponds to 'If something chases the cow then it is young'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Chases x Cat ∧ Red Cat → Needs Cat Rabbit -- Corresponds to 'If something chases the cat and the cat is red then the cat needs the rabbit'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Young x → Chases x Rabbit -- Corresponds to 'If something is young then it chases the rabbit'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Kind x ∧ Chases x Rabbit → Sees Rabbit Cow -- Corresponds to 'If something is kind and it chases the rabbit then the rabbit sees the cow'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Cold x → Sees x Cow -- Corresponds to 'If something is cold then it sees the cow'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Young x ∧ Needs x Cow → Needs Cow Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'If something is young and it needs the cow then the cow needs the squirrel'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Needs x Cat → Chases x Cow -- Corresponds to 'If something needs the cat then it chases the cow'
axiom R8 : ∀ x : obj, Needs x Cow → Needs x Cat -- Corresponds to 'If something needs the cow then it needs the cat'
axiom R9 : Chases Squirrel Rabbit → Red Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'If the squirrel chases the rabbit then the squirrel is red'

-- So let's try to prove the negation of the theorem, which is The squirrel is red
theorem squirrel_is_red : Red Squirrel :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R9, which states that if the squirrel chases the rabbit, then the squirrel is red.
  apply R9,
  -- We now need to show that the squirrel chases the rabbit.
  -- According to rule R3, if something is young, then it chases the rabbit.
  -- We apply rule R1 to show that the squirrel is young because it chases the cow.
  apply R3,
  apply R1,
  -- We apply rule R7 to show that the squirrel chases the cow because it needs the cat.
  apply R7,
  -- We apply rule R8 to show that the squirrel needs the cat because it needs the cow.
  apply R8,
  -- We know that the squirrel needs the cow by axiom T10.
  exact T10,
end

-- The answer is False
