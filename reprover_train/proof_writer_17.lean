constant obj : Type u

-- Declare constants for our objects
constant Anne : obj -- Corresponds to 'Anne'
constant Charlie : obj -- Corresponds to 'Charlie'
constant Erin : obj -- Corresponds to 'Erin'
constant Harry : obj -- Corresponds to 'Harry'

-- Declare constants for our predicates
constant Smart : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is smart'
constant Blue : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is blue'
constant Quiet : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is quiet'
constant Nice : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is nice'
constant Round : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is round'
constant Green : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is green'
constant Young : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is young'

-- Define our axioms based on the provided statements
axiom T1 : Smart Anne -- Corresponds to 'Anne is smart'
axiom T2 : ¬ Blue Charlie -- Corresponds to 'Charlie is not blue'
axiom T3 : Quiet Charlie -- Corresponds to 'Charlie is quiet'
axiom T4 : ¬ Nice Erin -- Corresponds to 'Erin is not nice'
axiom T5 : Round Erin -- Corresponds to 'Erin is round'
axiom T6 : Green Harry -- Corresponds to 'Harry is green'
axiom T7 : Young Harry -- Corresponds to 'Harry is young'

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Smart x → Green x -- Corresponds to 'Smart things are green'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Round x → Young x -- Corresponds to 'If something is round then it is young'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x ∧ Green x → ¬ Quiet x -- Corresponds to 'If something is blue and green then it is not quiet'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Green x ∧ Smart x → Round x -- Corresponds to 'If something is green and smart then it is round'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Young x → Blue x -- Corresponds to 'If something is young then it is blue'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Smart x → Nice x -- Corresponds to 'Smart things are nice'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Quiet x ∧ ¬ Smart x → Young x -- Corresponds to 'If Harry is quiet and Harry is not smart then Harry is young'

-- Theorem: Anne is not quiet?
theorem anne_is_not_quiet : ¬ Quiet Anne :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R3, which states that if something is blue and green then it is not quiet.
  apply R3 Anne,
  -- We now need to show that Anne is blue and green.
  split,
  -- To show that Anne is blue, we apply rule R5, which states that if something is young then it is blue.
  -- We know that Anne is young because she is round (by rule R4, since Anne is green and smart), so we can apply R5 to Anne.
  apply R5,
  apply R2,
  apply R4 Anne,
  split,
  -- Anne is green by rule R1, since Anne is smart.
  apply R1,
  exact T1,
  -- Anne is smart by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
  -- Anne is green by rule R1, since Anne is smart.
  apply R1,
  exact T1,
end

-- The answer is True
