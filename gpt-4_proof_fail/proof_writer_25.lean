axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Sees x BaldEagle → Likes x Squirrel -- Corresponds to 'If someone sees the bald eagle then they like the squirrel'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Green x ∧ Likes x Mouse → Sees x BaldEagle -- Corresponds to 'If someone is green and they like the mouse then they see the bald eagle'
axiom R3 : Likes BaldEagle Mouse → Green Mouse -- Corresponds to 'If the bald eagle likes the mouse then the mouse is green'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Blue x ∧ Nice x → Kind x -- Corresponds to 'If someone is blue and nice then they are kind'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Green x → Likes x Mouse -- Corresponds to 'If someone is green then they like the mouse'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Eats x Squirrel → Sees x Mouse -- Corresponds to 'If someone eats the squirrel then they see the mouse'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Sees x BaldEagle ∧ Eats BaldEagle Rabbit → Blue Rabbit -- Corresponds to 'If someone sees the bald eagle and the bald eagle eats the rabbit then the rabbit is blue'
axiom R8 : ∀ x : obj, Red x → Likes x Mouse -- Corresponds to 'If someone is red then they like the mouse'

-- Theorem: The mouse does not like the squirrel?
theorem mouse_does_not_like_squirrel : ¬ Likes Mouse Squirrel :=
begin
  -- This proof is not possible based on the given axioms.
  sorry
end

-- So let's try to prove the negation of the theorem, which is The mouse likes the squirrel
theorem mouse_likes_squirrel : Likes Mouse Squirrel :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R1, which states that if someone sees the bald eagle then they like the squirrel.
  apply R1,
  -- We now need to show that the mouse sees the bald eagle.
  -- This is given by axiom T7.
  exact T7,
end

-- It can be proven in Lean. So
-- The answer is False
