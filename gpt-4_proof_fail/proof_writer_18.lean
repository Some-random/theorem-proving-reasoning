axiom T7 : Sees Mouse Bear -- Corresponds to 'The mouse sees the bear'

axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Sees x Lion → Likes x BaldEagle -- Corresponds to 'If something sees the lion then it likes the bald eagle'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Likes x Bear → Likes x BaldEagle -- Corresponds to 'If something likes the bear then it likes the bald eagle'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Needs x Bear ∧ Blue Bear → Round Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something needs the bear and the bear is blue then the bear is round'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Likes x Mouse → Sees Mouse Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something likes the mouse then the mouse sees the bear'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Likes x Mouse ∧ Nice Mouse → Likes x Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something likes the mouse and the mouse is nice then it likes the bear'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Needs x Lion ∧ Likes x BaldEagle → Likes x Mouse -- Corresponds to 'If something needs the lion and it likes the bald eagle then it likes the mouse'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Likes x Bear ∧ Likes x Mouse → Needs Mouse Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something likes the bear and it likes the mouse then the mouse needs the bear'
axiom R8 : ∀ x : obj, Needs x Bear → Likes x Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something needs the bear then it likes the bear'
axiom R9 : ∀ x : obj, Likes x BaldEagle → Needs x Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something likes the bald eagle then it needs the bear'

-- Theorem: The mouse likes the bald eagle?
theorem mouse_likes_bald_eagle : Likes Mouse BaldEagle :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R6, which states that if something needs the lion and it likes the bald eagle then it likes the mouse.
  apply R6,
  -- We now need to show that the Mouse needs the Lion and likes the Bald Eagle.
  split,
  -- We show that the Mouse needs the Lion using axiom T2.
  exact T2,
  -- We apply rule R1, which states that if something sees the lion then it likes the bald eagle.
  apply R1,
  -- We now need to show that the Mouse sees the Lion.
  -- However, we do not have any axiom or rule that can show this.
  sorry,
end

-- The answer is False
