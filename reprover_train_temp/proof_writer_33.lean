-- Theorem: Bob is white?
theorem bob_is_white : White Bob :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R4, which states that if someone is blue and furry then they are white.
  apply R4,
  -- We now need to show that Bob is blue and furry.
  split,
  -- Bob is blue by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
  -- To show that Bob is furry, we apply rule R6, which states that all young people are furry.
  -- We know that red people are young (by rule R7), so we need to show that Bob is red.
  -- We apply rule R3, which states that cold, blue people are red.
  -- We know that Bob is blue (by axiom T1), so we need to show that Bob is cold.
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that all round people are cold.
  -- We know that Bob is round (by axiom T2), so Bob is cold.
  apply R6,
  apply R7,
  apply R3,
  split,
  -- Bob is cold by applying rule R2 and axiom T2.
  apply R2,
  exact T2,
  -- Bob is blue by axiom T1.
  exact T1,
end

-- The answer is True
