axiom R1 : ∀ x : obj, Young x → Sees x Cow -- Corresponds to 'If something is young then it sees the cow'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Young x ∧ Likes x Bear → Green Bear -- Corresponds to 'If something is young and it likes the bear then the bear is green'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Sees x Squirrel → Sees Squirrel Cat -- Corresponds to 'If something sees the squirrel then the squirrel sees the cat'
axiom R4 : Sees Squirrel Cat → Chases Cat Bear -- Corresponds to 'If the squirrel sees the cat then the cat chases the bear'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Green x → Chases x Cow -- Corresponds to 'If something is green then it chases the cow'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Chases x Cow → Young x -- Corresponds to 'If something chases the cow then it is young'

-- Theorem: The bear sees the cow?
theorem bear_sees_cow : Sees Bear Cow :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R1, which states that if something is young then it sees the cow.
  apply R1,
  -- We now need to show that the bear is young.
  -- We apply rule R6, which states that if something chases the cow then it is young.
  apply R6,
  -- We now need to show that the bear chases the cow.
  -- We apply rule R5, which states that if something is green then it chases the cow.
  apply R5,
  -- We now need to show that the bear is green.
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that if something is young and it likes the bear then the bear is green.
  apply R2,
  -- We now need to show that something is young and it likes the bear.
  -- We know that the cat likes the bear (by axiom T5), so we need to show that the cat is young.
  -- We apply rule R6, which states that if something chases the cow then it is young.
  -- We know that the cat chases the cow (by axiom T2), so the cat is young.
  split,
  apply R6,
  exact T2,
  -- We show that the cat likes the bear using axiom T5.
  exact T5,
end

-- The answer is True
