-- Theorem: Harry is red?
theorem harry_is_red : Red Harry :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R7, which states that if someone is rough then they are red.
  apply R7,
  -- We now need to show that Harry is rough.
  -- We apply rule R4, which states that all quiet people are rough.
  apply R4,
  -- We now need to show that Harry is quiet.
  -- We apply rule R5, which states that kind people are quiet.
  apply R5,
  -- We now need to show that Harry is kind.
  -- We apply rule R6, which states that if someone is green then they are kind.
  apply R6,
  -- We now need to show that Harry is green.
  -- We apply rule R2, which states that if someone is nice then they are green.
  apply R2,
  -- We now need to show that Harry is nice.
  -- This is given by axiom T10.
  exact T10,
end

-- The answer is True
