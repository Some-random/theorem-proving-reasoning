-- Introducing basic types for entities in our universe.
constant Fish : Type
constant Stonefish : Fish

-- Defining properties and relations among the entities.
constant may_sting : Fish → Prop
constant stings : Fish → Prop
constant cause_death_if_not_treated : Fish → Prop
constant apply_heat_to_treat : Fish → Prop
constant use_antivenom_to_treat : Fish → Prop

-- Providing axioms based on the information given.

-- Some fish may sting.
axiom A1 : ∃ (f : Fish), may_sting f
-- Stonefish is a fish.
axiom A2 : may_sting Stonefish
-- It stings to step on a stonefish.
axiom A3 : stings Stonefish
-- Stonefish stings cause death if not treated.
axiom A4 : cause_death_if_not_treated Stonefish
-- To treat stonefish stings, apply heat to the affected area or use an antivenom.
axiom A5 : apply_heat_to_treat Stonefish ∨ use_antivenom_to_treat Stonefish → ¬ cause_death_if_not_treated Stonefish

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
-- If you step on a stonefish and don’t use an antivenom, it will cause death.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.

theorem some_fish_sting_causes_death : ∃ (f : Fish), stings f ∧ cause_death_if_not_treated f :=
begin
    existsi Stonefish,
    split,
    exact A3,
    exact A4,
end

-- Let's try the negative case.
