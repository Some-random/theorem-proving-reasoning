All round things are nice. All kind, red things are rough. If something is big then it is quiet. If something is rough then it is round. If Charlie is nice and Charlie is big then Charlie is not kind. If something is red then it is kind. If something is round and nice then it is not big.\nQuestion: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? Fiona is not rough.",
