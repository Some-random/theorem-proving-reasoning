The squirrel chases the lion. If something is cold then it sees the rabbit. If something sees the rabbit then it sees the squirrel. If something is cold and it sees the squirrel then the squirrel is cold. If something chases the squirrel then it needs the squirrel. If something chases the squirrel and it is not cold then the squirrel does not chase the rabbit. If the rabbit sees the squirrel and the squirrel chases the rabbit then the rabbit does not chase the squirrel. If the rabbit chases the squirrel and the squirrel does not chase the rabbit then the squirrel needs the mouse.\nQuestion: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? The squirrel is not cold.",
