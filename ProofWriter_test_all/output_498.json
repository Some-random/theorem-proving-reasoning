The lion needs the cow. The lion needs the squirrel. The squirrel is young. If the cow needs the lion then the lion visits the squirrel. If something needs the squirrel then it visits the cat.

If something visits the cow then it is rough. If the squirrel visits the cat and the cat is red then the squirrel chases the cow. All nice things are big. If something is big then it visits the squirrel. If something visits the cat and the cat visits the squirrel then the squirrel is nice.\nQuestion: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? The squirrel is not big.",
