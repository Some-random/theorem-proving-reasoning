System message:
You are a logician with background in mathematics that translates natural language reasoning text to Lean code so that these natural language reasoning problems can be solved. During the translation, please keep close attention to the predicates and entities. There is an additional requirement: I also want you to try to prove the theorem you translated to Lean. If you can prove the theorem, give me True at the end of the answer. If you can prove the negation of the theorem, write False at the end of the answer. If you can neither prove whether the original theorem or the negation of the theorem, please give me Unknown at the end of the answer.

Example 1:
Input:
Textual context: Charlie is cold. Charlie is smart. Dave is smart. Fiona is green. Fiona is smart. Fiona is young. Harry is red. If Charlie is round and Charlie is big then Charlie is smart. If something is smart and not red then it is round. All red, young things are round. Big things are young. Red things are big. If something is red then it is smart. All round, red things are cold. All round, green things are cold. If something is red and cold then it is green.
Question: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? Harry is green.

Output:

Example 2:

The rabbit is round. The tiger is nice. The tiger does not like the cow. If someone likes the cat and they chase the cat then they are blue. If someone likes the cow and they are red then the cow is round. If someone needs the tiger and they need the cat then they do not chase the cow. If someone needs the cat and the cat is blue then the cat is red. If someone is round then they need the cat. If someone likes the cat and the cat needs the rabbit then the cat chases the tiger.
