Let's break down the given theory and rules:

Statements:

Charlie is cold.
Charlie is smart.
Dave is smart.
Fiona is green.
Fiona is smart.
Fiona is young.
Harry is red.
Rules:

Rule 1: If Charlie is round and Charlie is big then Charlie is smart.
Rule 2: If something is smart and not red then it is round.
Rule 3: All red, young things are round.
Rule 4: Big things are young.
Rule 5: Red things are big.
Rule 6: If something is red then it is smart.
Rule 7: All round, red things are cold.
Rule 8: All round, green things are cold.
Rule 9: If something is red and cold then it is green.

The question is: Is Harry not cold?

From the theory we know that Harry is red.

Following the rules:

From Rule 5, we know that "Red things are big". Therefore, Harry is big.

From Rule 4, we know that "Big things are young". Therefore, Harry is young.

From Rule 3, we know that "All red, young things are round". Therefore, Harry is round.

From Rule 7, we know that "All round, red things are cold". Therefore, Harry is cold.

Thus, the statement "Harry is not cold" is false based on the provided theory and rules.

The answer is False
