Let's break down these statements and rules and analyze them one by one:

The cow is big.
The cow needs the dog.
The dog sees the rabbit.
The rabbit chases the cow.
The rabbit chases the dog.
The rabbit is big.
The rabbit sees the dog.
And the rules:

Rule 1: If the cow is blue and the cow needs the rabbit then the cow needs the dog.
Rule 2: If the cow chases the dog then the cow sees the rabbit.
Rule 3: If something is big then it chases the dog.

The question is: Does the cow see the rabbit?

Firstly, let's apply Rule 3 because both the cow and the rabbit are described as being big. Rule 3 states, "If something is big then it chases the dog". Therefore, according to this rule, both the cow and the rabbit chase the dog.

Secondly, having established that the cow chases the dog (from Rule 3), we can apply Rule 2 which states, "If the cow chases the dog then the cow sees the rabbit."

So, based on this sequential application of rules, the cow does indeed see the rabbit.

The answer is True
