Let's dissect the provided statements and rules:

Charlie is cold.
Charlie is smart.
Dave is smart.
Fiona is green.
Fiona is smart.
Fiona is young.
Harry is red.
And the rules:

Rule 1: If Charlie is round and Charlie is big then Charlie is smart.
Rule 2: If something is smart and not red then it is round.
Rule 3: All red, young things are round.
Rule 4: Big things are young.
Rule 5: Red things are big.
Rule 6: If something is red then it is smart.
Rule 7: All round, red things are cold.
Rule 8: All round, green things are cold.
Rule 9: If something is red and cold then it is green.

The question is: Is Harry green?

First, we know that Harry is red from the initial set of statements.

Now let's use the rules to derive further information:

Rule 5 states that "Red things are big". Therefore, Harry is big.

Rule 4 states that "Big things are young". Therefore, Harry is young.

Rule 3 states that "All red, young things are round". Therefore, Harry is round.

Rule 7 states that "All round, red things are cold". Therefore, Harry is cold.

Rule 9 states that "If something is red and cold then it is green". Given that Harry is both red and cold, by applying this rule, we conclude that Harry is indeed green.

The answer is True
