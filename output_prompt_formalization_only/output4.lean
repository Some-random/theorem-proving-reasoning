-- Declare constants for our objects
constant Charlie : obj -- Corresponds to 'Charlie'
constant Dave : obj -- Corresponds to 'Dave'
constant Fiona : obj -- Corresponds to 'Fiona'
constant Harry : obj -- Corresponds to 'Harry'

-- Declare constants for our predicates
constant Cold : obj → Prop -- Corresponds to 'is cold'

-- Define our axioms based on the provided statements
axiom T1 : Cold Charlie -- Corresponds to 'Charlie is cold'
axiom T2 : Smart Charlie -- Corresponds to 'Charlie is smart'
axiom T3 : Smart Dave -- Corresponds to 'Dave is smart'
axiom T4 : Green Fiona -- Corresponds to 'Fiona is green'
axiom T5 : Smart Fiona -- Corresponds to 'Fiona is smart'
axiom T6 : Young Fiona -- Corresponds to 'Fiona is young'
axiom T7 : Red Harry -- Corresponds to 'Harry is red'

axiom R1 : Round Charlie ∧ Big Charlie → Smart Charlie -- Corresponds to 'If Charlie is round and Charlie is big then Charlie is smart'
axiom R2 : ∀ x : obj, Smart x ∧ ¬ Red x → Round x -- Corresponds to 'If something is smart and not red then it is round'
axiom R3 : ∀ x : obj, Red x ∧ Young x → Round x -- Corresponds to 'All red, young things are round'
axiom R4 : ∀ x : obj, Big x → Young x -- Corresponds to 'Big things are young'
axiom R5 : ∀ x : obj, Red x → Big x -- Corresponds to 'Red things are big'
axiom R6 : ∀ x : obj, Red x → Smart x -- Corresponds to 'If something is red then it is smart'
axiom R7 : ∀ x : obj, Round x ∧ Red x → Cold x -- Corresponds to 'All round, red things are cold'
axiom R8 : ∀ x : obj, Round x ∧ Green x → Cold x -- Corresponds to 'All round, green things are cold'
axiom R9 : ∀ x : obj, Red x ∧ Cold x → Green x -- Corresponds to 'If something is red and cold then it is green'

-- Theorem: Harry is not cold?
theorem harry_is_not_cold : ¬ Cold Harry :=
begin
  -- This proof is not possible based on the given axioms.
  sorry
end

-- So let's try to prove the negation of the theorem, which is Harry is cold
theorem harry_is_cold : Cold Harry :=
begin
  -- We apply rule R7, which states that all round, red things are cold.
  apply R7,
  -- We now need to show that Harry is round and red.
  split,
  -- To show that Harry is round, we apply rule R3, which states that all red, young things are round.
  -- We know that Harry is red (by axiom T7), so we need to show that Harry is young.
  -- We apply rule R4, which states that big things are young.
  -- We know that red things are big (by rule R5), so Harry is big, and therefore young.
  apply R3,
  split,
  -- Harry is red by axiom T7.
  exact T7,
  apply R4,
  apply R5,
  exact T7,
  -- Harry is red by axiom T7.
  exact T7,
end

-- It can be proven in Lean. So
-- The answer is False
