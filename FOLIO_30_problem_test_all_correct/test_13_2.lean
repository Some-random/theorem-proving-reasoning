-- Providing axioms based on the information given.

-- If a player is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are among the most active players in major tennis.
axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Player), is_ranked_highly_WTA p → is_most_active_major_tennis p

-- Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Player), lost_to p IgaSwiatek → is_ranked_highly_WTA p

-- All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Player), is_female_tennis_player_RolandGarros2022 p → lost_to p IgaSwiatek

-- Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022.
axiom A4 : ∀ (p : Player), is_female_tennis_player_RolandGarros2022 p ∨ is_male_tennis_player_RolandGarros2022 p

-- All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.
axiom A5 : ∀ (p : Player), is_male_tennis_player_RolandGarros2022 p → lost_to p RafaelNadal

-- If Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.
axiom A6 : (is_ranked_highly_WTA CocoGauff ∨ lost_to CocoGauff RafaelNadal) → ¬ is_male_tennis_player_RolandGarros2022 CocoGauff
