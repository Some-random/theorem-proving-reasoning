constant Person : Type

-- Defining the property of a person being a twin or triplet

-- If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings
axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), Twin_or_triplet p → Spend_time_with_siblings p
-- If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), Siblings_same_age p → Twin_or_triplet p
-- If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age
axiom A3 : ∀ (p : Person), Complain_about_siblings p → Siblings_same_age p
-- If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members
axiom A4 : ∀ (p : Person), Not_live_at_home_regularly p → ¬ Develop_strong_bonds p
-- If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly
axiom A5 : ∀ (p : Person), Spend_time_with_siblings p → Not_live_at_home_regularly p
-- Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members
axiom A6 : (Twin_or_triplet Luke ∧ Develop_strong_bonds Luke) ∨ 
            (¬ Twin_or_triplet Luke ∧ ¬ Develop_strong_bonds Luke)

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
-- Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.
-- Let's first prove the positive case.
