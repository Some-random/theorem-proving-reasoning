-- Introducing basic types for entities in our universe.
constant Language : Type
constant LanguageFamily : Type

-- Defining specific instances of languages and language families.
constant French : Language
constant Spanish : Language
constant German : Language
constant Basque : Language
constant Romance : LanguageFamily
constant IndoEuropean : LanguageFamily

-- Defining properties and relations among the entities.
constant is_in_family : Language → LanguageFamily → Prop
constant is_related_to : Language → Language → Prop

-- Providing axioms based on the information given.

-- All Romance languages are Indo-European languages.
axiom A1 : ∀ (l : Language), is_in_family l Romance → is_in_family l IndoEuropean

-- All languages within a language family are related to each other.
axiom A2 : ∀ (l1 l2 : Language) (f : LanguageFamily), is_in_family l1 f ∧ is_in_family l2 f → is_related_to l1 l2

-- French and Spanish are both Romance languages.
axiom A3 : is_in_family French Romance
axiom A4 : is_in_family Spanish Romance

-- German is related to Spanish.
axiom A5 : is_related_to German Spanish

-- Basque is not related to any other language.
axiom A6 : ∀ (l : Language), ¬ is_related_to Basque l

-- Formalizing the Questions

-- Question 1
