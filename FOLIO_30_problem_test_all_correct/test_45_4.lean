-- All people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child
axiom A1 : ∀ (p : Person), Has_wedding p → Has_child p
-- All people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding
axiom A2 : ∀ (p : Person), Honeymoon_Paris p → Has_wedding p
-- All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon
axiom A3 : ∀ (w : Wedding), Wedding_July w → ∃ p : Person, Honeymoon_Paris p
-- Some weddings in July are well-attended
axiom A4 : ∃ w : Wedding, Wedding_July w ∧ Well_attended w
-- If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding
axiom A5 : Has_child John → ¬ Honeymoon_Paris John ∧ ¬ Has_wedding John
-- If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon
axiom A6 : Well_attended Johns_wedding → Wedding_July Johns_wedding ∨ Honeymoon_Paris John
